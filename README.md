# lfz-config

Configuration files used by LFZ template projects

This repo contains configuration files, such as lint configuration, that are used by all LFZ templates. This allows these configuration files to be maintained in one location and used by each project.

The files in the `config` folder should be imported into configuration files at the root of the project.
